Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is a strategic auto-battler developed by Riot Games. It is set in the League of Legends universe and challenges players to build, position, and strategize teams of champions. Each set introduces unique gameplay elements, traits, and mechanics, creating endless possibilities for strategy.

Set 6: Gizmos & Gadgets
This set focused on innovation and invention. Key traits included Innovator, which allowed players to summon mechanical companions, and Chemtech, where champions gained regeneration and attack speed based on missing health. These mechanics brought dynamic and adaptable gameplay.

Set 7: Dragonlands
Dragonlands featured mythical dragons and beasts, introducing high-fantasy elements. Traits like Jade created healing statues that buffed allies, while Dragons added unique, high-cost units with powerful abilities. This set emphasized synergy and sustainability.

Set 8: Monsters Attack!
Monsters Attack! embraced a superhero versus supervillain theme, bringing chaos to the battlefield. Traits like Anima Squad granted fame for kills, giving permanent health bonuses. Underground allowed players to complete heists for escalating rewards, offering high-risk, high-reward gameplay.

Above were my favorite sets personally, however, the following set is the new release:

Set 13: Into the Arcane
Released on November 20, 2024, this set immerses players in the world of Arcane, introducing new champions such as Powder, Vi, Vander, and Sevika. New traits like Enforcer, Chem-Baron, Academy, Firelight, and Family add fresh strategic layers. The Anomaly mechanic allows players to transform a champion with unique effects during the game.

Each set in TFT has introduced fresh challenges, innovative mechanics, and engaging synergies. The game remains dynamic and complex, appealing to both casual and competitive players with its strategic depth.
